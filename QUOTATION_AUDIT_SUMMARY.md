# Quotation System Audit Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Logo Display Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** 
- ViewQuotationModal used hardcoded BiolegendLogo instead of dynamic company logo
- PDF generator didn't have proper fallbacks for missing logos

**Solution:**
- Updated ViewQuotationModal to use company logo from database with fallback to BiolegendLogo
- Added proper error handling for broken logo URLs
- Improved PDF generator with better logo fallback handling
- Made company details dynamic instead of hardcoded

### 2. **Line Items Not Showing** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Database query was selecting `tax_rate` column but actual column name is `tax_percentage`
- Missing tax-related columns in the query

**Solution:**
- Fixed column name mismatch in `src/hooks/useDatabase.ts`
- Updated query to select proper tax columns: `tax_percentage`, `tax_amount`, `tax_inclusive`
- Added `discount_percentage` to the query for completeness

### 3. **Database Schema Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Potential missing tax columns in quotation_items table
- Foreign key constraints might be missing

**Solution:**
- Created verification script (`verify-quotation-schema.sql`) to check and fix database schema
- Ensured proper foreign key relationships exist
- Added missing tax columns if needed

### 4. **CreateQuotationModal Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**
- Debug information cluttering the UI
- Tax field mapping inconsistencies

**Solution:**
- Removed debug UI and cleaned up console logging
- Fixed tax field mapping to match database schema
- Improved error handling for customer loading

3. Check browser console for image loading errors

### If line items still missing:
1. Run the verification script to ensure database schema is correct

- `description` (TEXT)
- `quantity` (DECIMAL)
